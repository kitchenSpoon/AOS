        _Static_assert is provided in recent compilers as a way of testing a
        condition at compile-time. By default, this library detects whether
        _Static_assert is available and defines an analogue of it if not.
        Sometimes you want to force the latter behaviour if the tool consuming
        your C code does not understand _Static_assert (e.g. the verification
        C parser). This option forces the analogue to be used.
